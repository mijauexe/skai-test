OPTIMAL JOB INTERVIEW SCHEDULING

TASK OVERVIEW
The task is to develop a REST API endpoint that processes POST requests containing two lists: start times and end times of job interviews. The goal is to calculate the maximum number of non-overlapping interviews a person can attend, considering that transitioning from one interview to another requires no time if the next interview starts exactly at or after the previous one ends.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Write a REST endpoint that receives a POST request with JSON data in a format similar to the one given in the following example:
{
  "start_times": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60],
  "end_times": [15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65]
}

2. Implement an algorithm to calculate the maximum number of interviews a person can attend without any overlap.
3. Return the response formatted in the following way:
{
  "max_interviews : 3
}
4. Follow RESTful principles when designing your API endpoint. Ensure your API responds with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK for successful requests, 400 Bad Request for invalid input).

EVALUATION CRITERIA
- Code Quality: Code readability, maintainability, simplicity, and adherence to best practices are essential.
- Correctness: Your algorithm must accurately determine the maximum number of interviews that can be attended, given the constraints.
- Efficiency: The solution should be optimized with regard to algorithmic time complexity.
